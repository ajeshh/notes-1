# Todo App as an API
Build a (or re-build your existing) todo app that works with AJAX requests.

You will need:

- a model for your todo items (content should be enough)
- a controller for your todo items that responds to .json
- jQuery

Try implementing this without using the scaffold generator.

Bonus points for having a view that renders all todo items and changes in real time whenever your CRUD data.
